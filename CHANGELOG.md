 - Made some bullet impact SFX a little less loud
 - Increased "stop animation on damage" damage threshold

## Fixed
 - Absolutely terrible oversight in the serialisation and deserialisation of wires. Wires should no longer turn pink / disappear after paste or load. This should also fix a whole bunch of other problems to do with the serialisation of specific objects.
 - An awful design flaw to do with continuous activation signals. This should not introduce any unexpected behaviour unless you expect something to be broken. Some contraptions may rely on this inconsistency, and they will break. Most contraptions will benefit from this and behave a lot more consistently. It should also reduce (pretty much eliminate) activation signal limit warnings. 
 - Improved fast moving wire performance

 - Lava pool to Hybrid
 - Buttons have a double trigger mode
 - Underwater objects may transfer charge to other near underwater objects
 - Tempered glass pane
 - You can hold M (can rebind) while using pins to snap to the center of mass of the undelying object. This is useful for things like putting pins in the exact center of wheels. It also magically allows you to put pins outside the object. This may be extended to other tools in the future, but it's just pins for now. It's pins.
 - Liquid container pressure now travels through valves and such. This may introduce some unfamiliar, however correct, behaviour.
 - ModAPI.OnLinkCreated and ModAPI.OnPinCreated events. The modding wiki is being worked on intensely so these events may not be documented for a while. They are invoked when a link device is created (currently only the phase link) and when a pin is created, respectively.
 - Partial proper documentation: https://www.studiominus.nl/ppg-modding/internalReference.html. It isn't completely done yet so there may be some issues. Not everything has an explanation yet but I have done the most important parts.

## [1.19.2] - June 28 2021

## Added
